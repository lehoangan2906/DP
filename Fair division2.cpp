// If the sum of all the weights is not divisible by two, then it is impossible to divide the candies between two people. If the sum is
// divisible, then let's count the number of candies with a weight of 1 and 2. Now, if we can find a way to collect half the sum with 
// some candies, then these candies can be given to Alice, and all the rest can be given to Bob.
//
// Simple solution ‚Äî let's iterate through how many candies of weight 2 we will give to Alice, then the remaining weight should be filled
// by candies of weight 1. If there are enough of them, then we have found a way of division.
//
// In fact, if the sum is even and there are at least two candies with weight 1 (there can't be one candy), then the answer is always "YES"
// (we can collect the weight as close to half as possible with weight 2 and then add weight 1). If there are no candies with weight 1, then 
// you need to check whether ùëõ is even (since all the candies have the same weight, you just need to divide them in half).
